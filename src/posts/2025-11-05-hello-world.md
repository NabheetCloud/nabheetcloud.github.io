# From SAP to Open Source to AI: My Ongoing Learning Journey

Welcome to **Tech Learnings** — a space where I share lessons from the trenches of engineering.

This isn't a theory-driven blog. It's a running log of what I'm learning, breaking, fixing, and re-thinking while building real systems.

## How It Started

I began my career deep inside the SAP ecosystem — ABAP, S/4HANA, RAP models, and enterprise-scale workflows.

It taught me structure, discipline, and how mission-critical systems run in the real world.

But I also saw the friction: long release cycles, heavy tooling, and closed innovation loops.

That curiosity led me to the **open-source world** — ERPNext, Odoo, Node.js, and Python.

Here, I discovered speed, community, and freedom to experiment. I started building distributed systems, integrating commerce platforms, and optimizing backend performance end-to-end.

And now, the journey continues into **AI** — exploring LLMs, agents, and intelligent systems that reshape how we write code, design architectures, and even think about engineering itself.

## Learning in a Constantly Changing World

Technology moves fast — uncomfortably fast.

Instead of chasing trends, I focus on **principles that survive change**: system thinking, simplicity, and clarity.

To stay current, I combine three habits:

1. **Build constantly** — nothing beats learning by shipping real things.
2. **Read and reason** — from research papers to release notes.
3. **Teach publicly** — writing forces clarity; clarity leads to mastery.

In 2025, my focus areas include:

- Building agentic systems using LLMs and vector databases
- Improving backend observability and performance tuning
- Designing scalable architectures for commerce and ERP integrations
- Exploring how AI can co-author, review, and optimize code

## Why This Blog Exists

**Tech Learnings** isn't about showing finished work — it's about documenting *how learning actually happens*.

Each article will share both successes and dead ends, so others can skip the pain and build faster.

Expect deep dives into:

- **System Design & Architecture:** Distributed patterns that actually scale
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Practical use of LLMs, agents, and data pipelines
- **Engineering Craft:** Testing, code quality, and developer experience

## A Quick Glimpse of Code

```javascript
// Calculate Fibonacci sequence
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
```

This blog is my way of keeping score — sharing wins, losses, and everything in between.

Let's learn together. 🚀
